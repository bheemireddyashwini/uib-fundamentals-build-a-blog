    <h1>Idli recepie</h1>

    <h2>History</h2>

        <p class="paragraph"> A precursor of the modern idli is mentioned in several ancient Indian works. Vaddaradhane, a 920 CE Kannada
            language work by Shivakotiacharya, mentions "iddalige", prepared only from a black gram batter. Chavundaraya
            II, the author of the earliest available Kannada encyclopedia, Lokopakara (c.1025 CE), describes the
            preparation of this food by soaking black gram in buttermilk, ground to a fine paste, and mixed with the
            clear water of curd and spices.The Western Chalukya king and scholar Someshwara III, reigning in the
            area now called Karnataka, included an idli recipe in his encyclopedia, Manasollasa (1130 CE). This
            Sanskrit-language work describes the food as iḍḍarikā. In Karnataka, the Idli in 1235 CE is described as
            being "light, like coins of high value", which is not suggestive of a rice base. The food prepared using
            this recipe is now called uddina idli in Karnataka. </p>

        <p class="paragraph"> The recipe mentioned in these ancient Indian works leaves out three key aspects of the modern idli recipe:
            the use of rice (not just black gram), the long fermentation of the mix, and the steaming for fluffiness.
            The references to the modern recipe appear in the Indian works only after 1250 CE. Food historian K. T.
            Achaya speculates that the modern idli recipe might have originated in present-day Indonesia, which has a
            long tradition of fermented food. According to him, the cooks employed by the Hindu kings of the Indianised
            kingdoms might have invented the steamed idli there, and brought the recipe back to India during 800-1200
            CE. Achaya mentioned an Indonesian dish called "kedli", which according to him, was like an
            idli. However, Janaki Lenin was unable to find any recipe for an Indonesian dish by this name.
            According to food historian Colleen Taylor Sen the fermentation process of idli batter is a natural process
            that was discovered independently in India, since nearly all cultures use fermentation in some form.</p>

        <h2> Preparation</h2>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>To make Idli, four parts uncooked rice (idli rice or parboiled rice) to one part whole white lentil
                (black gram, Vigna mungo) are soaked separately for at least four hours to six hours or overnight</li>
            <li>Optionally spices such as fenugreek seeds can be added at the time of soaking for additional flavour.
            </li>
            <li>Once done soaking, the lentils are ground to a fine paste and the rice is separately coarsely ground,
                then they are combined</li>
            <li>Next, the mixture is left to ferment overnight during which its volume will more than double.</li>
            <li>After fermentation, some of the batter may be kept as a starter culture for the next batch.</li>
            <li>The finished idli batter is put into greased moulds of an idli tray or "tree" for steaming.</li>
            <li>The perforated molds allow the idlis to be cooked evenly</li>
            <li>The tree holds the trays above the level of boiling water in a pot, and the pot is covered until the
                idlis are done (about 10-25 minutes, depending on size)</li>
            <li>A more traditional method is to use leaves instead of moulds.</li>
        </ol>

            <h2>Serving</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Since plain idlis are mild in taste, a condiment is considered essential. Idlis are often served with
                chutneys
                (coconut-based), sambar and Medu vada. However, this varies greatly by region and personal taste, it is
                also
                often served with kaara chutney (onion-based) or spicy fish curries. The dry spice mixture podi is
                convenient
                while travelling. </p>
