  <h1> Puri recipe</h1>
  <section>
    <p><b>Puri Recipe </b>(sometimes spelled as poori) is a deep-fried bread made from unleavened whole-wheat flour
      that originated in the Indian subcontinent. It is eaten for breakfast or as a snack or light meal. It is usually
      served with a savory curry or bhaji, as in puri bhaji, but may also be eaten with sweet dishes</p>

    <p>Puris are most commonly served as breakfast and snacks. It is also served at special or ceremonial functions as
      part of ceremonial rituals along with other vegetarian food offered in prayer as prasadam.</p>
    <h2>About Puri</h2>
    <p> A basic poori recipe is made with whole wheat flour, salt, and water. These are only three ingredients you need.
      A bit of oil or ghee can be added to the whole wheat dough optionally. The dough is not leavened or fermented, so
      it’s a wonderfully quick and easy bread to make.</p>
    <p> Small balls of dough are rolled and flattened, and quickly fried in hot oil. The poori puffs up to create light,
      crispy pillows that just beg to be bitten into. Inside is soft and tender, and perfect for using to scoop up a
      hearty curry.</p>
    <p> Make a batch of this poori recipe for a snack now or for your dinner tonight, then have leftovers with breakfast
      in the morning. There is never a wrong time to enjoy soft and crispy poori!</p>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <p>Homemade puri only takes about 40 minutes to make from start to finish. Be sure to read the entire poori recipe,
      including my tips for the best puri below before you get started! </p>
    <ol>
      <li>First, mix together 3 cups whole wheat flour (360 grams), 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon oil (optional) in a
        large bowl. For more crispy puri, you can add ¼ cup fine rava (sooji or semolina). </li>
      <li> Add just a bit of water at a time as you begin to form the dough, making sure to not oversaturate the
        mixture.</li>
      <li>Knead the dough with a wooden spoon or your hands, or use a standing mixer. Again, add only a splash or two of
        water at a time as you work.</li>
      <li> Continue to knead until you form a stiff, tight dough. It should not be soft like a roti or a bread loaf. You
        can add about ¾ to 1 cup of water in total. </li>
      <li> Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let the dough rest for 20 to 30 minutes at room
        temperature.</li>
      <li> When ready to use, divide the dough into about 30 small or 25 medium pieces, and roll each into a tight ball.
      </li>
      <li> Next, use the palm of your hand to lightly flatten the dough ball, and then apply a bit of oil to the entire
        surface. </li>
      <li>This helps the bread fry evenly and rise properly, without the need to dust with flour first (which runs the
        risk of creating burnt flour particles in your oil)</li>
      <li>Then place the rolled poori on a plate, and loosely cover with a clean kitchen towel so that they don’t dry
        out.</li>
      <li> First, heat oil in a deep pan (kadai). Test the oil by dropping a small dough ball into oil. If it rises
        quickly to the top, then the oil is hot enough for frying. Once you have the oil to the right temperature,
        carefully add one puri at a time.</li>
      <li> It should begin to puff up almost immediately after it hits the hot oil.</li>
      <li> Give it a nudge with a slotted spoon or spider spoon to keep the puri moving and therefore cooking evenly.
      </li>
      <li> Gently press and nudge the puri on the sides with a slotted spoon or spider spoon to help it puff up
        completely.</li>
      <li>Continue to fry for just a minute or two, until the oil stops bubbling and the bottom of the puri is golden to
        your liking.</li>
    </ol>
