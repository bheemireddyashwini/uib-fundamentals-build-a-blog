            <h2>Idli Recipe</h2>
            <img src="../images/new- pic-idli.jpg" alt="idli" width="300">
            <p><b>Idli</b> or <b>idly</b> is a type of savoury rice cake, originating from South India, popular as a
                breakfast food in
                Southern India and in Sri Lanka. The idles are made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black
                lentils (de-husked) and rice. The fermentation process breaks down the starches so that they are more
                readily metabolised by the body. </p>

            <h2>Masala-dosa Recipe</h2>
            <img src="../images/dhosa-masala-plain.webp" alt="masaladosa" width="300" >
            <p><b>Masaladosa</b> is a dish of South India. It is a type of dosa originating in the town of Udupi,
                Karnataka. While
                there is variation in the recipe from town to town,the basic recipe typically starts with a fermented
                batter
                of parboiled rice, poha, and various legumes (black gram, pigeon peas, chickpeas), and incorporates
                various
                spices for flavour, such as fenugreek and dry red chilli. Traditionally served with potato curry,
                chutneys,
                and sambar, it is a common breakfast item in South India,though it can also be found in many other parts
                of
                the country and overseas. One common variant is the paper masala dosa, which is made with a thinner
                batter,
                resulting in a crisper, almost paper-thin final product. </p>
