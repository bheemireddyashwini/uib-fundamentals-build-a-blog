    <section>
      <p>
        <b>Masala dosa </b> is a dish of South India.It is a type of dosa
        originating in the town of Udupi, Karnataka. While there is variation in
        the recipe from town to town, the basic recipe typically starts with a
        fermented batter of parboiled rice, poha, and various legumes (black
        gram, pigeon peas, chickpeas), and incorporates various spices for
        flavour, such as fenugreek and dry red chilli. Traditionally served with
        potato curry, chutneys, and sambar, it is a common breakfast item in
        South India, though it can also be found in many other parts of the
        country and overseas. One common variant is the <b>Paper masala dosa, </b>which
        is made with a thinner batter, resulting in a crisper, almost paper-thin
        final product.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p> The dosa originated in <b>South India,</b> but its precise geographical origins are unknown. According to food historian K. T. Achaya, references in the Sangam literature suggest that dosa was already in use in the ancient Tamil country around the 1st century CE. However, according to historian P. Thankappan Nair, dosa originated in the town of Udupi in present-day Karnataka. Achaya states that the earliest written mention of dosa appears in the 8th-century literature of present-day Tamil Nadu, while the earliest mention of dosa in Kannada literature appears a century later.</p>
      <p>
        In popular tradition, the origin of the dosa is linked to <b>Udupi</b>, probably because of the dish's association with Udupi restaurants. The Tamil dosa is traditionally softer and thicker; the thinner and crispier version of dosa was first made in present-day Karnataka.A recipe for dosa can be found in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day <b> Karnataka.</b></p>

      <h2>Preparation</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>A mixture of rice and white gram that has been soaked in water for at least 4-5 hours is ground finely to form a batter</li>
        <li>Some add a bit of soaked fenugreek seeds while grinding the batter. </li>
        <li>The proportion of rice to lentils is generally 3:1 or 4:1. After adding salt, the batter is allowed to ferment overnight, before being mixed with water to get the desired consistency.</li>
        <li>The batter is then ladled onto a hot tava or griddle greased with oil or ghee. It is spread out with the base of a ladle or a bowl to form a pancake. </li>
        <li>It can be made either thick like a pancake, or thin and crispy</li>
        <li>A dosa is served hot, either folded in half or rolled like a wrap</li>
        <li>It is usually served with chutney and sambar.</li>
        <li>The mixture of white grams and rice can be replaced with highly refined wheat flour or semolina.
